{"cells":[{"source":"# Analyzing Motorcycle Parts Sales Data\n\nIn this project, we will be analyzing the sales data of a company that sells motorcycle parts. They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.\n\nThe board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. Their `sales` table includes the following data:\n\n\n## Sales\n| Column | Data type | Description |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| `order_number` | `VARCHAR` | Unique order number. |\n| `date` | `DATE` | Date of the order, from June to August 2021. |\n| `warehouse` | `VARCHAR` | The warehouse that the order was made from&mdash; `North`, `Central`, or `West`. |\n| `client_type` | `VARCHAR` | Whether the order was `Retail` or `Wholesale`. |\n| `product_line` | `VARCHAR` | Type of product ordered. |\n| `quantity` | `INT` | Number of products ordered. | \n| `unit_price` | `FLOAT` | Price per product (dollars). |\n| `total` | `FLOAT` | Total price of the order (dollars). |\n| `payment` | `VARCHAR` | Payment method&mdash;`Credit card`, `Transfer`, or `Cash`. |\n| `payment_fee` | `FLOAT` | Percentage of `total` charged as a result of the `payment` method. |","metadata":{},"id":"13335817","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"We will run a query to get an overview of the data in detail:","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"249514d2-1b28-4e06-8838-cd4a72188f0e"},{"source":"SELECT *\nFROM sales\nLIMIT 10;","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"revenue_by_product_line","sqlCellMode":"dataFrame","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"89e17161-a224-4a8a-846b-0adc0fe7a4b1","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":1444,"lastExecutedAt":1750862232394,"lastExecutedByKernel":"0effe575-f8a7-421c-9045-700c0b3e796d","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"SELECT *\nFROM sales\nLIMIT 10;","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"08f79824-92fb-4cb8-96d6-0a96ca31e8bf","nodeType":"const"},"sort":{"sortModel":[{"colId":"quantity","sort":"asc"}]}}}}},"cell_type":"code","id":"59e81fc8-7849-4ee6-81f2-f7b75363d976","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"order_number","type":"string"},{"name":"date","type":"datetime","tz":"UTC"},{"name":"warehouse","type":"string"},{"name":"client_type","type":"string"},{"name":"product_line","type":"string"},{"name":"quantity","type":"integer"},{"name":"unit_price","type":"number"},{"name":"total","type":"number"},{"name":"payment","type":"string"},{"name":"payment_fee","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],"order_number":["N1","N2","N3","N4","N5","N6","N7","N8","N9","N10"],"date":["2021-06-01T00:00:00.000","2021-06-01T00:00:00.000","2021-06-01T00:00:00.000","2021-06-01T00:00:00.000","2021-06-01T00:00:00.000","2021-06-02T00:00:00.000","2021-06-02T00:00:00.000","2021-06-03T00:00:00.000","2021-06-03T00:00:00.000","2021-06-03T00:00:00.000"],"warehouse":["North","North","North","North","North","North","North","North","North","North"],"client_type":["Retail","Retail","Wholesale","Wholesale","Retail","Retail","Retail","Retail","Retail","Retail"],"product_line":["Braking system","Suspension & traction","Frame & body","Suspension & traction","Frame & body","Frame & body","Miscellaneous","Electrical system","Suspension & traction","Electrical system"],"quantity":[9,8,16,40,6,1,6,9,5,5],"unit_price":[19.29,32.93,37.84,37.37,45.44,40.41,20.28,20.5,36.18,28.33],"total":[173.61,263.45,605.44,1494.8,272.61,40.41,121.66,184.54,180.91,141.67],"payment":["Cash","Credit card","Transfer","Transfer","Credit card","Credit card","Credit card","Credit card","Credit card","Credit card"],"payment_fee":[0,0.03,0.01,0.01,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.03,0.03]}},"total_rows":10,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"  order_number                      date  ...      payment payment_fee\n0           N1 2021-06-01 00:00:00+00:00  ...
